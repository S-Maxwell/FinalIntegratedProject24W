                <p>Gertrud Sorensen is an artist who was born in Austria and now lives in Canada. She used to run a business with her husband, Fritz, at The Bear Trail Couples Resort, but now she focuses on her art. Gertrud has a big studio where she has over 30 paintings displayed. Her paintings show the different seasons in Algonquin Park with lots of colors. She learned from other artists and got inspiration from nature. You can see her paintings in her studio at The Bear Trail Couples Resort. If you visit, you can even watch her paint and maybe buy one of her paintings as a special gift.</p>
